                Hello! Welcome to my final project page! 
                This project was created as a final for my front end 
                development course that uses all the skills we had 
                learned throughout our bootcamp. This project is a 
                basic social media platform where you can make posts 
                and delete them from the site. The site also features a 
                fully functional navigation bar with routing to different 
                pages on the site. I hope you enjoy looking at the site and 
                feel free to send me any questions on GitHub or LinkedIn!
